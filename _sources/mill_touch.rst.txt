==========
Mill Touch
==========

A QtPyVCP interface for a 3 axis mill with a touch screen. I tried to layout
the screen to be as efficient as possible for me. Your needs may be different.

This interface uses the new VTK backplot which is a lot faster and more memory
efficient than Gremlin.

Mill Touch also takes advantage of the new containers with rules. As you can see
everything in the tool offset tab is disabled because no tool is loaded.

Now you can see the whole tab is enabled after loading a tool.
